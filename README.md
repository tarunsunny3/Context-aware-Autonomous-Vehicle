Mobile Computing Course Project

- It involved design and simulation of Level 3 autonomous vehicle control handling.
- Decide when we should give the control to the Human in the Loop, and when the autonomous part of the vehicle should take control.
- Designed Fuzzy system and used MCMC model to simulate the real-world road conditions, speeds using Gaussian Model, etc
